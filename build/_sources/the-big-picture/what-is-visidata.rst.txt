What Is VisiData?
=================

`VisiData <http://visidata.org/>`_ is a free, open-source tool that lets you **quickly open, explore, summarize, and analyze** datasets in your computer's terminal.

.. note::

    You **don't need to be a programmer** to use VisiData. Knowing `a little bit of Python <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html>`_, however, will make VisiData even more powerful for you.



Why use VisiData?
-----------------

- It's fast.
    - VisiData opens in a blink of an eye, and can load multi-megabyte datasets nearly instantly.
- It's nimble.
    - VisiData makes it easy to search, filter, sort, and join any table.
- It's great for getting a grasp of new datasets.
    - With just a few keystrokes, you can summarize any column.
- It works with :ref:`lots of data formats <compatible-filetypes>`.
    - CSV, Excel, JSON, and more.
- It's non-destructive.
    - VisiData won't alter your raw data unless you explicitly tell it to.
- It's keyboard-driven.
    - You never have to reach for a mouse.
- It lives in your terminal.
    - VisiData plays well with other command-line tools, and you can run it on remote servers via SSH.


Why not use VisiData?
---------------------

VisiData isn't for every task. You might want to choose another tool for:

- Complex analysis.
    - You're probably better off using Python, R, or another programming language.
- "Literate" analysis.
    - Although VisiData lets you save and replay your analyses, it's not as legible/flexible as Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown, or other tools.
- Mission-critical analysis.
    - VisiData is well-engineered, but still a relatively young piece of software.
