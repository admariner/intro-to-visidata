Saving Sheets
=============

To save your current sheet to a **file**, press :kbd:`Control-s`. VisiData will prompt you with a suggested filename, which you can edit. The filename extension (e.g., ``.csv``, ``.json``, et cetera) will determine the format of the saved file. Once you're satisfied, press :kbd:`Enter`. 

You can also copy *selected* rows to your **system clipboard** by typing :kbd:`gY` and following the prompt.

.. tip::
   If you install the `python-tabulate <https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate>`_ Python package, VisiData can also save/copy a sheet in `any text-table format that the package supports <https://github.com/astanin/python-tabulate#table-format>`_. To save a sheet as a GitHub-flavored Markdown table, for instance, use the ``.github`` suffix.
