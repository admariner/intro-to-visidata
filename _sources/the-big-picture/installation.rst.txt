Installation
============

Installing VisiData is pretty easy. First, you'll need the following:

- A computer running Linux or MacOS
- `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
- `A little bit of comfort <http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line>`_ with your computer's command line

Then, open your terminal and run this command:

::

    pip3 install visidata

To test that VisiData installed correctly, run this:

::

    vd --version

You should see something like the following:

.. raw:: html
    :file: ../../terminal/output/version.output.html

(On the command line, ``vd`` and ``visidata`` are synonymous. You can use either to launch VisiData.)

.. note::

   If you'd like to "sandbox" VisiData and its dependencies from the rest of your Python libraries, consider `installing it via pipx <https://gist.github.com/jsvine/4fd295176b4f5257dfb89b3898a21a7e>`_.
